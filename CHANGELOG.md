## [1.5.0] 2026-03-26 — Training Tool Upgrade

### Added
- **Pipe support** — single and multi-stage pipes (`ls | grep yaml`, `cat file | wc -l`, `cat file | grep err | wc -l`)
- **Redirect support** — overwrite (`ls > out.txt`) and append (`echo hello >> notes.txt`)
- **Theme-based Task Mode** — 5 topic-grouped themes replacing the previous linear 10-task list:
  - 📁 File Navigation (5 tasks): ls, pwd, ls -la, cd, find
  - 📄 File Content (4 tasks): cat, head, tail, wc
  - ⚙️ File Operations (5 tasks): mkdir, touch, cp, mv, rm
  - 🔍 Search & Filter (3 tasks): grep, ls|grep, cat|wc
  - ✏️ Vim Editing (3 tasks): open+quit, insert+save, dd+save
- **Theme selector** — card grid UI to pick a theme; completed themes show a ✓ badge
- **Progress persistence** — filesystem state, command history, and task progress saved to `localStorage`; survives page refresh
- **`reset` command** — type `reset` in the terminal to clear all saved progress
- **↺ Reset button** — in the task panel footer for quick reset

### Changed
- `tasks.js` replaced by `task-themes.js` with richer per-theme structure
- `doGrep` and `doWc` now accept piped stdin (no file arg required when used in pipeline)
- Task completion now resets `taskFlags` on each advance to prevent stale flag bleed-through

## [1.4.0] 2026-03-26 — Task Mode

### Added
- **Task Mode** — structured learning mode with 10 progressive exercises, toggled via a new "Tasks" button in the top bar
  - Tasks guide beginners from basic directory listing (`ls`, `pwd`) through file reading, search, creation, copy, and Vim editing
  - Collapsible task panel shows current task title and description; expands to reveal full description and controls
  - **💡 Hint button** — answer (e.g. `ls -la`) is hidden by default; revealed only on request so users try on their own first
  - Auto-advances to the next task 2.5 seconds after success, with a ✓ toast notification
  - Prev / Skip navigation to move between tasks freely
  - "All done" toast + auto-exit after completing all 10 tasks
- Task panel fully i18n'd across Traditional Chinese, English, and Japanese
- In Task Mode, command-explanation toasts are suppressed so only task-completion feedback is shown
- Amber (`#ffbd2e`) accent colour for task UI, distinct from the green terminal theme; full light-mode overrides included

## [1.3.0] 2026-03-25 — Tips panel

### Added
- **Tips button** (⌨ Tips) — floating semi-transparent button at bottom-right of terminal
- **Mode-aware shortcut panel** — slides in from right, content changes based on current mode:
  - Terminal mode: Ctrl shortcuts (Ctrl+A/E/U/K/W/C/L + arrows, history, Tab)
  - Vim Normal mode: hjkl movement, insert-entry keys, dd/x, command-mode shortcuts
  - Vim Insert mode: arrow navigation, Esc, Backspace, Tab
- **Clickable shortcut items** — each tip can be clicked to execute the action directly
- Tips panel re-renders on every keypress to stay in sync with mode changes
- Full i18n support for all tip group names and descriptions (zh / en / ja)

---

## [1.2.0] 2026-03-25 — Vim bug fixes

### Fixed
- `dd` now correctly requires pressing `d` twice to delete a line (was deleting on single `d`)
- Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) now work in Vim insert mode for cursor navigation
- Added `pendingOp` state to `viState` so `Escape` properly cancels a pending `d` operator

---

## [1.1.0] 2026-03-25 — Light/Dark mode + i18n (zh / en / ja)

### Added
- **Theme toggle** (☀️ / 🌙) in top bar — switches between dark and light mode
- **Language switcher** (中 / EN / 日) in top bar — Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese
- Light mode CSS with full variable override (terminal, keyboard, hints, status bar)
- Translated: welcome messages, command explanations, Ctrl shortcut hints, Vim hints, help output

### Changed
- Single-file `terminal-practice.html` refactored into maintainable multi-file structure:
  - `index.html` — HTML entry point
  - `style.css` — All styles (dark + light mode variables)
  - `filesystem.js` — Virtual filesystem data
  - `app.js` — Core application logic (language-agnostic)
  - `lang/zh.js` — Traditional Chinese translations
  - `lang/en.js` — English translations
